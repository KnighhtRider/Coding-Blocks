/*

Suppose there are n friends that want to go to a party. Each friend can either alone to the party 
or paired up with some other friend and go as a couple. Find out the total number of ways in which
n friends can go to the party.

Example :

	Input : n = 3
	Output: 4
	Explanation : {{1, 2, 3}, 
	               {12, 3}, 
	               {1, 23}, 
	               {13, 2}} 

	Input : n = 4
	Output: 10
	Explanation : {{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
	               {12, 3, 4}, 
	               {13, 2, 4}, 
	               {14, 2, 3}, 
	               {1, 23, 4}, 
	               {1, 24, 3},
	               {1, 2, 34},
	               {12, 34},
	               {13, 24},
	               {14, 23}}
